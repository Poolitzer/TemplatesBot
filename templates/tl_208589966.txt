Keys end with 'i' and 'ios' for iOS templates, 'a' and 'android' - for Android, 'wp' and 'windowsphone' - for Windows Phone.
Headings start with hyphen so that it's easier to ctrl/command+F them here (try '-Secret chats' for instance).
Should you have any questions or suggestions, please write to your local groups and tag them with #templates.

{COMMENT}
This template is intended for negative feedback. Please adjust it accordingly if the user requests for more information or has particular concerns that can be resolved.
- Concerns about losing particular data: Telegram Desktop can be used to backup it
- Concerns about accidental deletion: there's an option to undo it within the next 5 seconds.
- Concerns that messages can become ambiguous without context: if someone deletes particular messages, you can delete more — or even clear the whole chat for both sides; also note that people could already forward messages out of context before today.
{VALUE}
Starting with version 5.5, you can delete any messages you have sent or received in your private chats for both participants, without any time limit. In short, both you and your chat partner have full control over the conversations the two of you have: https://telegram.org/blog/unsend-privacy-emoji

This is a prominent change and I understand that there may be arguments against it, just like with other privacy-focused features. Similar to calls, messages don't leave an unerasable trace anymore, but unlike calls, the amount of information stored is directly controlled by the conscious choice of both participants of the conversation.

By the way, as the Telegram Support Force is run by volunteers, we don't have the power to decide which features are introduced. However, what we can and will do is pass on your thoughts on to the developers.

If you have any further questions about how the apps work or need help in solving issues you encounter, please let us know - we'll be glad to help!

This is the support chat for Telegram apps. Since Telegram is open-source, there are many Telegram-based apps made by developers all over the world, with different names and features, and you're currently using one of them.

You're free to choose any app you prefer — at your own risk. However, we can only guarantee your Telegram experience if you use our official clients. They are free, show no ads and get the latest features first.

You can download our officially approved app here:
https://telegram.org/dl/android	

Switching to the official app is easy because all chats are stored in the Telegram Cloud (except for Secret Chats). If you move, you will keep all your cloud conversations, groups and contacts.

{VALUE}
In order to work more reliably on weak mobile connections, we use a custom protocol. It allows us to send your encrypted messages using less data.

We also have a unique server infrastructure that allows you to communicate using servers close to you - which means that data needs to travel shorter distances. And sending less data over shorter distances means that we can do it faster than anybody else.

{QUESTION}
(EN) How does Telegram encryption work?
{KEYS}
cryptoen
encrypteden
encryptionen
{VALUE}
We support two layers of secure encryption (server-client and client-client). Our encryption is based on 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, RSA 2048 encryption and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange.

When a secret chat is created, the participating devices exchange encryption keys using the so called Diffie-Hellman key exchange. After the secure end-to-end connection has been established, we generate a picture that visualizes the encryption key for your chat.

You can then compare this image with the one your friend has — if the two images are the same, you can be sure that the secret chat is secure and no man-in-the-middle attack can possibly succeed.

We only read the messages that you send directly to us - for example, in this support chat. Telegram is not a commercial company, but a non-profit open source project that lives off a donation.

We created Telegram to make safe and free messaging available for everybody. Our reputation and your privacy are the only things that we care about.

In fact, you don't even need to trust us. If you use our end-to-end encrypted Secret chats, it is technically impossible for anyone except your recipient to read the messages.

{VALUE}
Security is one of Telegram's main attractions; everything you send and receive is heavily encrypted. Your cloud chat data is stored encrypted in the Telegram Cloud.

And if you don't like the idea of syncing chats across many devices, try our Secret Chats. Messages in secret chats use end-to-end encryption and can only be deciphered on you and your recipient's devices. They are not part of the cloud and can only be accessed on the device that you started them on. And if you log out on that device, they are gone.

{QUESTION}

{KEYS}
inven

lastseenrecentlyen
{VALUE}
You can set who can see your last seen and online statuses in Privacy and Security settings > Last Seen & Online.

Note that you won‘t see 'Last Seen' and online statuses for people with whom you don’t share your own. You will, however, see an approximate 'last seen' value. There are four possible approximate values:

- Last seen recently — covers anything between 1 second and 2-3 days
- Last seen within a week — between 2-3 and 7 days
- Last seen within a month — between 6-7 days and a month
- Last seen a long time ago — more than a month (this is also always shown to blocked users)

As you can see, these stages are not clearly separated, so you cannot calculate much from this data. This keeps stalkers away but makes it easy to see whether a person is reachable over Telegram.

1 check = message delivered to the Telegram cloud (and is waiting for your chat partner to see it in Telegram), notification sent (if the recipient is accepting notifications).

2 checks = message read (recipient opened Telegram and the conversation with your message).

We don't have an additional status for 'message delivered to device', because you can use Telegram on multiple devices simultaneously. Since you don't know which one of their devices the person is actually using, delivery to one of the devices becomes irrelevant.

{QUESTION}

You can set who can see your online and last seen statuses in Privacy and Security settings > Last Seen & Online.

If you don't share your last seen with someone, they will only see you 'Online' for a brief period when it’s obvious that you’re online:
- When you have just sent a message to them or to a group where you are both members.
- When you have just read a message they sent you in a one-on-one chat.
- When you show as "typing..." messages - to them, or in a group where you are both members.

When you delete a chat or clear chat history, you'll get an option to undo it within the next 5 seconds. Once the time is up, there is no more way to restore them, sorry.

But hey, did you ask your chat partner if they still have the chat? If this wasn't a secret chat, your friend could export the chat and send it to you or manually forward you specific chat messages you need. And if it was a secret chat, they may be able to take screenshots for you or just copy the text if screenshots are disabled on their device.

If you'd like to meet new people on Telegram, check Contacts > Find People Nearby in our mobile apps to see users around you who have chosen to be visible to others. You can enable "Make Myself Visible" to join them — if you do that, people nearby will be able to find you and send you messages.

Alternatively, you can create a group with your friends, and then ask them to add their friends as well — or join an already existing public group, try our @PublicTestGroup for example.

There are also unofficial bots designed for getting in touch with other users. Try searching the web for 'Telegram bots new friends' – you'll get many results.

Please remember: You can use Telegram search to find people by their usernames – but this is not a tool for finding new friends. People don't like it when strangers contact them via username search, so it might result in people reporting you.

We do not have an official store for bots, the platform is open for anyone to use. I'll give you a few examples – but please note that these bots were made by third-party developers, not by the Telegram team.

@TriviaBot – test your trivia knowledge or add to groups to compete with friends.
@hangbot – play the Hangman game online or add to groups to play together with your friends.
@AlertBot – set a time and this bot will send you a reminder.

Inline bots are even easier to use. You don't need to send them messages or add them to your groups – just type their @username in the message field in any chat, then type some keywords, and the bot will offer you relevant content. Here are several sample bots for you to try out: @gif, @vid, @pic, @wiki, @imdb, @gamee.

Please be careful when using any bots that promise free cryptocurrency or offer wallet services. They are not official and not connected to Telegram in any way.

If anyone is offering you free cryptocurrency or extremely high returns on any kind of investment, it is almost always too good to be true – stay away and stay safe.

{VALUE}
Telegram's gaming platform enables bot developers to create in-chat games, but the Telegram team doesn’t control the way each game works, so cheating can occur. In order to prevent this, we would need to sync not only the results, but every action players take in every game, with the developer's server — which would be hard for developers to set up and maintain.

Cheating is a problem for many games, including those that are published on the App Store or Google Play. In each case, it is up to the game developers to catch any cheaters. As more and more games are published by third-party developers over time, we hope you will be able to find games that work just as you want them to.

Secret chats:

- Use end-to-end encryption
- Feature an optional self-destruct timer for all kinds of messages
- Have no cloud synchronization
- Send a screenshot alert
- Are unusable after logging out
- Do not allow messages to be forwarded outside of them
- Prevent data backup
- Can only be used on one device
- Are perfect as a temporary chat

To sum it up, Secret chats are super convenient for a short chat; for permanent conversations cloud chats are more convenient. All chats on Telegram are of course always encrypted. More about secret chats here: https://telegram.org/faq#secret-chats

Telegram cloud chats (and groups) are securely encrypted in the Telegram cloud so that you can quickly access them from any of your devices, even if you reinstall the app. Only if you delete something in your chat is it gone forever (unless your chat partner can send it back to you).

Secret Chats use end-to-end encryption and can only be deciphered on the two participating devices. Downside of that: you can't access them from your other devices and if you reinstall Telegram, or even log out of your account, your secret chats will be lost.

Secret Chats also have an optional timer (from 1 second to 1 week) for all kinds of messages.

While your Cloud Chats can be accessed from any of your devices anytime, Secret Chats are not part of the Telegram Cloud and are device-specific by design. This way you can always be sure that they are safe for as long as your phone is safe in your pocket. Secret Chats also use end-to-end encryption, so they can’t be synced in the same simple and convenient way as Cloud Chats. We may add support for multi-device Secret Chats in the future.

Meanwhile, if you want your conversations to be synced across many devices, consider using Cloud Chats. Please note that they are encrypted as well and are further protected by Telegram's distributed infrastructure. Let me know if you want to learn more about security on Telegram.

{VALUE}
Secret chats require permanent storage on the device, something that Telegram Desktop and Telegram Web don’t support at the moment. We may add this in the future. Currently, both the desktop and the web app load messages from the Cloud on startup and discard them when you quit. Since secret chats are not part of the cloud, this would kill all your secret chats each time you shut down your computer.

Secret chats are also device-specific and disappear if you log out — considering this, it is handier to keep them on the one device that you always carry with you. In case you are concerned about the security of your chats on desktop, please note that they are encrypted as well and are further protected by Telegram's distributed infrastructure. Let me know if you want to learn more about security on Telegram.

{VALUE}
All Telegram data is encrypted and cannot be deciphered by your ISP, network administrator or random hackers. Cloud chats are stored encrypted in the Telegram Cloud, and the keys needed to decipher this data are kept in other data centers in different jurisdictions. This way, local intruders or engineers can't access this data, and several court orders from different jurisdictions are required to force us to give up anything. More on this in the FAQ: https://telegram.org/faq#q-do-you-process-data-requests

Secret chats are meant for people who want even more than that. They use end-to-end encryption, so there is no way to decipher your data without accessing your device. It means you don‘t even need to trust Telegram when you use Secret Chats — their secrecy is guaranteed client-side and anyone can check the source code of Telegram clients.

If you are concerned about security in general, there are other important precautions you could take. Consider protecting your account by enabling 2-Step Verification and setting up a strong passcode to lock your app. You will find both options in ‘Settings’ under ‘Privacy and Security’, ask me if you’d like more details.

We understand that certain usernames are part of an online identity for some of us. If your desired username is already taken, we will be happy to help you acquire it, provided that you have exactly the same username on at least two of these services: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram.

I am sorry, but Telegram doesn’t verify user accounts at the moment. Verification is only available for big and active official channels, bots or public groups:

Please note that verification doesn’t give any extra abilities in Telegram. It is only of use if you want to demonstrate that your account here is official. If this is the case with you, here’s another idea: you could post your Telegram username on your official site or any official account you have elsewhere — this will prove you are you to your audience and help them find you here.

If this is the case, please add a link to your Telegram channel to your profiles on these services — so that we can confirm that they indeed belong to you. Once this is done, please contact our @VerifyBot for verification. More information about verification guidelines: https://telegram.org/verify

Please kindly note that verification doesn't give any extra abilities in Telegram - it is only of use if you want to demonstrate that your channel is official. A link on your official site or another official account elsewhere can achieve a similar result.

If you don't want people to contact you, it's best to remove the username. Alternatively, you could block people who are sending unwanted messages.

In a similar way, if you have enabled "Make myself visible" in Contacts > Find people nearby, other users can find you in the "People Nearby" section. You can disable it anytime if you don't want to receive messages from strangers.

The phone number is currently the only way for us to identify a Telegram user.

We collect no other information on you, and this means: whoever owns the number, owns the account. Unfortunately, to delete any data from an account, you need access to that account. In order to delete the account, you need to be logged in at least on one of your devices.

You can read more about it here:
https://telegram.org/faq#q-my-phone-was-stolen-what-do-i-do

Please note, that Telegram accounts have a self-destruct option that is enabled by default. This means that all Telegram accounts are automatically deleted after 6 months of inactivity (you can manually change this in Settings — Privacy and Security, with options ranging from 1 month to 1 year).

To do this: go to Telegram Settings > Phone number > Change number > type in your new number. If necessary, enter the code you will receive via an SMS to the new number - done!

For this to work, please make sure there is no existing Telegram account connected to the new number. If there is, please delete this new account before starting the transfer.

{VALUE}
It is important to keep your Telegram number up to date, since your provider may reassign your number to a different person when you stop using your old SIM. And in the current system the owner of the number is the owner of the Telegram account as well.

To change your number in Telegram, go to Settings, then tap on your number and then 'Change number'.

Note that when you change your number, your Telegram contacts will get the new number added to their address book — provided they had your older number and you haven't blocked them in Telegram.

{VALUE}
If you want to change your current phone number in Telegram, you must first ensure that your new number does not have a Telegram account connected to it. If there is one, you need to delete it before starting the transfer.

Note: If you delete the account currently connected to your new number, it cannot be recovered - so please make sure you don't need the account before deleting it.

If you wish to continue, below are the easiest steps to perform this process.

1. Use a mobile device to log in with the account currently associated with your new number. Telegram apps let you stay signed in on several accounts simultaneously:
Android: Swipe right in the chat list to open the menu > Tap on the arrow down (next to your phone number) > Add Account.
iOS: Go to Telegram Settings > Edit > Add Another Account.
Turn off "Sync contacts" there, enter your new phone number and log in using the code you receive via SMS to the number.

2. https://telegram.org/deactivate — copy this link, open it in your browser and enter your new phone number there, in international format. 

3. You will now receive a password through Telegram (keep an eye on the app you logged on to in step 1). Enter the password and delete the account.

4. Now, open your main account and go to Telegram Settings > Phone number > Change number > type in your new number. If necessary, enter the code you will receive via an SMS to the new number.

Done!

First of all, sorry about your phone. Unfortunately, the phone number is the only way for us to identify a Telegram user at the moment, so for now you'll need to follow these steps:

1. First and foremost, you need to contact your SIM provider so that they can block your old SIM and issue you with a new one with the same number.
2. If you are logged in to Telegram on any of your other devices, go to Settings > Privacy and Security > Active sessions (or Settings > Devices for mobile devices) and terminate all other sessions there. This will log out all other devices. If the old SIM has been blocked by this time, nobody can access your data. You can resume ordinary Telegram usage.
3. If you are not logged in to Telegram, wait till you receive your new SIM with the old number, log in to Telegram, then go to Settings - Terminate all other sessions. Then you can resume ordinary Telegram usage.

Please note, that Telegram accounts have a self-destruct option that is enabled by default. This means that all Telegram accounts are automatically deleted after 6 months of inactivity (you can manually change this in Settings - Privacy and Security, with options ranging from 1 month to 1 year).

Android, Android X: Swipe right in Chats list to open the menu, then Settings > tap '...' in the top right corner > 'Logout'.

iOS, macOS: Settings > Edit > scroll all the way down, then 'Logout'.

Telegram Passport lets you easily sign up for services that require personal identification. You can upload your documents once, then instantly share your data with services that require real-world ID (finance, ICOs, etc.).

The data will be stored in the Telegram cloud and protected by end-to-end encryption — so that nobody, including Telegram, can access it without your permission.

Once you've used this authorization method on any website that supports it, you will see your data in Settings > Privacy & Security > Telegram Passport (on iOS: Settings > Telegram Passport). Please note that if you haven’t uploaded any documents to your Telegram Passport yet, you won’t see it in the app menu.

I'm afraid you can't use SMS codes to log in to Telegram apps for desktop and web, so you need to log in to Telegram on mobile first. Sorry about this. If you don't have a smartphone, we can suggest the following workarounds:

1. Ask a friend or family member to lend you their phone. Log in to Telegram there, then receive a login code for your desktop device.
Note: turn off "Sync contacts" when logging in to Telegram on someone else's phone, so that the app doesn't sync your contacts with their phone book.

2. Use an emulator to run Android on your PC and install Telegram for Android. Try searching the web for "Android emulators" — you'll get many results.

{VALUE}
Sorry to hear about that. Video Calls are still under development, and will be improved as part of our future app updates.

Can you please help us investigate this problem? Here are a few important questions:

1. Describe exactly what is happening? (E.g. you heard your own voice, the other side kept dropping out, video was distorted, etc.)
2. Which platform (iOS, Android, etc.) and Telegram app is your recipient using?
3. Could you please send us the technical log for the call where you experienced issues? 

Here's how to do this — find the call in your conversation history, then:
Android: Tap next to the "Video Call" message > Rate Call >  Rate 1 Star and select "Include technical information" > tap Send. This will send a log file to a chat called "VOIP Support", if you can also forward this file from there to this "Volunteer Support" chat, that would help us a lot, thanks!
iOS: Tap and hold the "Video Call" message > Share Statistics > choose this "Volunteer Support" chat.
Desktop: Open the app folder > DebugLogs subfolder > send us the "last_call_log.txt" file.
macOS: Right-click the "Video Call" message > Share Call Logs > choose this "Volunteer Support" chat.

If you can, please also ask your conversation partner to send you their log file for the call. Then, you should forward it to us here. If anything is unclear or you encounter any issues, please let us know — we'll be glad to help!

Sorry to hear about your connection problems. Can you please help us investigate this? Here are a few important questions:

0. Do other apps work OK?
1. What exactly is happening? (always 'Connecting...' / always 'Updating...' / seems ok, but messages are not sent / not delivered, media files are not downloaded / not uploaded, etc.)
2. At what time did it start? Is it still happening?
3. Is this happening all the time or sometimes?
4. Does this happen with all Telegram apps - or just on one of your devices?
4a. (Try web.telegram.org - does it work?)
5. Does the problem happen on Wi-Fi, on mobile connection or in both cases?
6. @connectivity_test — please open this channel from the network with the problem and try to download all GIFs there. If some are not downloaded, send us their numbers.

(EN) How can I stop Telegram from using so much battery? (Android)
{KEYS}
drainen

savebatteryen
{VALUE}
There could be several reasons why Telegram is using a lot of battery on your Android device.

Please check the following:

- If you have a Battery Optimizer, Task Manager, Task Killer, or something similar installed: please put Telegram on the list of allowed apps (whitelist). If not whitelisted, the Telegram process will be restarted again and again when closed, and this will use a lot of energy from your device.

- Telegram uses Google Cloud Notifications (GCM) to wake the app and notify you for new messages. So make sure Google Play Services are installed on your phone.

Since GCM are not very reliable, we added an extra system to help notify you when new messages arrive. You can manage this system by toggling the "Keep-Alive Service", and "Background Connection" options, near the bottom of Telegram Settings > Notifications and Sounds.

Both settings may affect your battery life. If you toggle them both off and use only Google Cloud Notifications, this could result in unreliable notifications.

As for the report, bear in mind that Journalists from the Guardian, the Financial Times, and other reputable papers have had it since June 2016 and to this day they are unable to confirm a single statement from it.

This article is misleading clickbait, I'm afraid. Nothing was hacked — the author was simply looking to advertise his product. This article sounds ridiculous to any security specialist (e.g. take at look at the comments on Hacker News: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9095059).

In plain words it says something like "If I had a key to your home, I could open your door".

So you needn't worry if you don't give away your keys. To keep your device safe, avoid clicking on suspicious links, always keep your system updated to the latest version — and don't root your device.

And never trust people who try to scare you into buying their software.

- Bedenken über den Verlust bestimmter Daten: Telegram Desktop kann zur Sicherung verwendet werden
- Bedenken wegen versehentlicher Löschung: Es gibt eine Option, diese innerhalb von 5 Sekunden rückgängig zu machen.
- Beunruhigt, dass Nachrichten ohne Zusammenhang mehrdeutig werden könnten: Wenn jemand bestimmte Nachrichten löscht, kann man mehr löschen - oder sogar den gesamten Chat für beide Seiten löschen. Beachte, dass Leute bereits zuvor Nachrichten weiterleiten konnten - auch diese wären dann meist ohne Zusammenhang.
{VALUE}
Ab der Version 5.5 kannst du alle Nachrichten, die du in deinen privaten Chats gesendet oder empfangen hast, zeitlich unbegrenzt  bei beiden Chatpartnern löschen. Kurz gesagt, sowohl du als auch dein Chatpartner habt ab sofort die volle Kontrolle über die Gespräche, die ihr beide führt: https://telegram.org/blog/unsend-privacy-emoji

Dies ist eine drastische Änderung, und ich verstehe, dass es Argumente dagegen geben kann, genau wie bei anderen auf die Privatsphäre ausgerichteten Funktionen. Ähnlich wie bei Anrufen hinterlassen Nachrichten keine unlöschbare Spuren mehr, aber im Gegensatz zu Anrufen wird die Menge der gespeicherten Informationen direkt durch die bewusste Wahl beider Gesprächspartner gesteuert.

Da die Telegram Support Force von Freiwilligen geleitet wird, haben wir nicht die Macht zu entscheiden, welche Funktionen eingeführt werden. Wir können jedoch den Entwicklern alle Rückmeldungen weiterleiten.

Das hier ist der Support-Chat für Telegram Apps. Der Quelltext von Telegram ist öffentlich, daher erstellen Entwickler aus der ganzen Welt Telegram-basierte Apps mit anderen Namen und Funktionen. Genau so eine benutzt du gerade.

Dir steht natürlich frei, weiterhin diese angepasste Version zu benutzen — jedoch auf eigene Gefahr. Neue Funktionen und Sicherheit kann dir Telegram nur in den offiziellen Apps garantieren. Die Apps sind gratis und werbefrei.

Hier kannst du die offiziell genehmigte Version von Telegram herunterladen:
https://telegram.org/dl/android	

Ein Wechsel zur offiziellen App ist einfach, da alle deine Chats (bis auf Geheime Chats) in der Telegram Cloud gespeichert sind. Wenn du wechselst, wirst du alle deine Cloud Chats, Gruppen und auch Kontakte behalten.

{QUESTION}

Es gibt keine offizielle Telegram App für Symbiangeräte, da diese von der Leistung her einfach zu eingeschränkt sind.

Alles, was du in diesen Chat weiterleitest, kannst du auf all deinen synchronisierten Geräten (z.B. Zweithandy, etc.) einsehen.

Don't use this, if the user has a question on top of the insults (some start swearing when they think the answer takes too long, that's ok). If there is indeed a question — just ignore the insults and answer the question, this usually works in a sobering way for the offender.

Telegram kommt aus keinem bestimmten Land. Es ist ein globales Projekt mit Unterstützern aus aller Welt. Das Telegram Team bleibt selten lange an einem Ort und alle sind fast immer unterwegs.

Jeder hat ein Recht auf Privatsphäre und genau das ist das Ziel von Telegram. Um das zu gewährleisten, wurde Telegram so weit wie möglich dezentralisiert. Das Team, die Server und auch Firmen sind auf der ganzen Welt verteilt.

Wenn du erfahren möchtest, wer die Personen hinter Telegram sind, dann schau einfach mal auf unserer Hilfeseite nach:

Der Internetzugang am Handy ist manchmal etwas langsamer, deswegen benutzt Telegram ein selbstentwickeltes Protokoll. Dieses erlaubt es, deine verschlüsselten Nachrichten extrem zu verkleinern (weniger Daten werden verbraucht).

Außerdem verfügt Telegram über eine einzigartige Server-Verteilung, die immer den nächstgelegenen Server für dich wählt. Dadurch kommen sie schneller beim Empfänger an.

{QUESTION}
(DE) How does Telegram encryption work?
{KEYS}
cryptode
encryptedde
encryptionde
{VALUE}
Telegram unterstützt zwei Ebenen sicherer Verschlüsselung (Server-Client und Client-Client). Die Verschlüsselung basiert auf 256-bit symmetrischer AES Verschlüsselung, RSA 2048 Verschlüsselung und dem sicheren Diffie-Hellman Schlüsselaustauschverfahren.

Wenn ein Geheimer Chat erstellt wird, tauschen die zwei Endgeräte (Absendergerät und Empfängergerät) über das sogenannte Diffie-Hellman-Schlüsselaustauschverfahren ein Schlüsselpaar aus. Nachdem die sichere Ende-zu-Ende-Verbindung hergestellt wurde, erstellen die Apps eine Grafik, welche den Verschlüsselungsschlüssel für den Chat optisch darstellt.

Du kannst nun diesen Schlüssel mit dem deines Chatpartners vergleichen. Wenn beide Schlüssel identisch sind, heißt das, dass der geheime Chat absolut sicher ist und kein Man-in-the-Middle-Angriff stattfinden kann.

Wir lesen nur, was du uns direkt schickst, z.B. hier im Hilfe-Chat. Telegram ist ein Non-Profit-OpenSource-Projekt, das durch eine Spende finanziert wird.

Das heißt auch, dass keine Daten verkauft werden, denn Telegram wurde gegründet, damit jeder sicher und kostenlos chatten kann. Unser Ruf und deine Privatsphäre sind die einzigen Dinge, die für uns zählen.

Wenn du Zweifel hast, kannst du jederzeit unsere Geheimen Chats wählen. Diese sind Ende-zu-Ende verschlüsselt, es ist also technisch unmöglich, dass jemand außer dir und dem Empfänger eure Nachrichten liest.

Telegram ist sehr sicher. Alles was du sendest und empfängst ist stark verschlüsselt. Deine Cloud Chats werden verschlüsselt in der Telegram Cloud gespeichert.

Wenn du nicht die sichere Telegram Cloud nutzen möchtest, kannst du jederzeit unsere Geheimen Chats wählen, diese nutzen eine Ende-zu-Ende-Verschlüsselung, die nur auf deinem und dem Gerät des Empfängers entschlüsselt werden kann. Diese Chats sind dann aber nur auf dem einen Gerät verfügbar; im Falle einer Neuinstallation, oder wenn du dich abmeldest sind sie jedoch weg.

{KEYS}

Du kannst die "zuletzt gesehen"-Zeit und den Online-Zeitstempel in den Einstellungen → Privatsphäre und Sicherheit auswählen.

Den "zuletzt gesehen" Status kannst du übrigens nur von Personen sehen, mit denen du auch deinen teilst. Ansonsten wird die ungefähre Zeit angezeigt. Es gibt aktuell vier verschiedene Anzeigen:

- kürzlich: alles innerhalb einer Sekunde und 2-3 Tagen
- innerhalb einer Woche: zwischen 2-3 Tagen und 7 Tagen
- innerhalb eines Monats: zwischen 6-7 Tagen und einem Monat
- vor langer Zeit: mehr als einen Monat (wird auch bei blockierten Personen angezeigt)

Wie du sehen kannst, sind diese Bereiche nicht klar getrennt, so dass du aus diesen Daten nicht viel berechnen kannst. Das hält Stalker fern, macht es aber leicht zu erkennen, ob eine Person per Telegram erreichbar ist.

1 Haken = Nachricht versendet (befindet sich auf unserem Server und wartet darauf, dass dein Kontakt Telegram öffnet), Benachrichtigung gesendet (sofern der Empfänger Benachrichtigungen auch aktiviert hat).

2 Haken = Nachricht gelesen (Empfänger hat Telegram und die Konversation geöffnet, in der sich die Nachricht befindet).

Bei Telegram gibt es keinen extra "Nachricht zugestellt" Status, da man Telegram auf so vielen Geräten nutzen kann wie man will, und nicht klar wäre, an welches Gerät die Nachricht nun zugestellt ist.

{QUESTION}

{KEYS}

{VALUE}
Du kannst die "zuletzt gesehen"-Zeit und den Online-Zeitstempel in den Einstellungen → Privatsphäre und Sicherheit auswählen.

Es gibt einige Ausnahmen, denn manchmal ist es einfach offensichtlich, dass du online bist. Unabhängig von den 'zuletzt gesehen' Einstellungen sehen dich Freunde für einen kurzen Zeitraum online, wenn du Folgendes machst:
- Du sendest ihnen eine Nachricht in einem Einzelchat oder in einer Gruppe, in der ihr beide Mitglieder seid.
- Du liest eine Nachricht, die sie dir in einem privaten Chat geschickt haben.
- Du sendest den 'tippt gerade'-Status an einen gemeinsamen Chat.

Hast du deinen Chatpartner gefragt, ob er/sie noch den Chat hat? Wenn es sich nicht um einen Geheimen Chat handelt, kann dein Chatpartner einzelne Chatnachrichten manuell weiterleiten. Wenn es ein Geheimer Chat war, könnte die Person vielleicht Screenshots aufnehmen oder einzelne Texte kopieren, sofern die Nachrichten noch vorliegen.

{VALUE}
Wenn du neue Leute bei Telegram kennenlernen möchtest, wechsle in den Bereich Kontakte und dann "Leute in Ihrer Nähe finden" in unseren mobilen Apps, um Nutzer in deiner Umgebung zu sehen, die sich dafür entschieden haben, für andere sichtbar zu sein. Du kannst auf "Mich sichtbar machen" tippen, um dich ihnen anzuschließen, dann wirst du ebenfalls in dem Bereich für andere angezeigt und man kann dir Nachrichten senden.

Alternativ könntest du eine Gruppe mit Freunden erstellen und sie fragen, ob sie nicht Lust haben ihre Freunde einzuladen oder du betrittst eine der vielen öffentlichen Gruppen, wie beispielsweise die englischsprachige @PublicTestGroup.

Es gibt zudem Bots von Drittentwicklern, die dafür gedacht sind, neue Leute kennenzulernen. Eventuell hilft schon eine Suche in einer Suchmaschine nach 'telegram bots new friends', um einen tollen Bot zu finden.

Übrigens: Du kannst die Telegram Suche nutzen um andere Leute anhand ihres Benutzernamens zu finden - aber sie ist nicht dafür gedacht, wildfremde Leute zu kontaktieren. Sowas kann schnell dazu führen, dass du von diesen Leuten gemeldet wirst, also behalte das im Hinterkopf.

Du kannst alle deine Cloud Chats inkl. Medien mit der aktuellsten Version von Telegram Desktop (desktop.telegram.org) exportieren. 

Alle Chats exportieren: Telegram Desktop Einstellungen → Erweitert → Telegram-Daten exportieren.
Einzelne Chats exportieren: Chat mit Telegram Desktop öffnen → ... Menü rechts oben öffnen → Chatverlauf exportieren.

Es gibt weniger Gründe für eine Datensicherung, da ja Chats verschlüsselt in der Telegram Cloud liegen und du sie somit auf jedem deiner Geräte einsehen kannst. Eine Ausnahme gibt es: Geheime Chats sind immer nur auf dem Startgerät verfügbar.

Wenn dich jemand blockiert, werden deine Nachrichten nicht mehr zugestellt und du siehst einen Haken. Gibt die Person dich später wieder frei, erscheinen zwei Haken, obwohl die Person deine vorherige Nachrichten nicht erhalten hat. Neue Nachrichten werden natürlich wieder zugestellt.

Blockierte Leute:

- können dir keine Nachrichten schicken, geheime Chats starten oder dich in Gruppen einladen
- sehen dein Profilbild nicht
- sehen weder 'online', noch die 'zuletzt gesehen'-Zeit; dort steht dann "vor langer Zeit gesehen"

{KEYS}

GIFs sind animierte Bilder — sende sie als Datei (nicht als Bild) über die Büroklammer, damit Empfänger sie abspielen können.

Du kannst unsere eingebaute GIF-Suche benutzen oder unseren Inline-Bot: Tippe einfach @gif im Chatfenster ein und dahinter direkt den Suchbegriff (z.B. "Katzen"). Wenn du ein paar Sekunden wartest, wird dir der Bot ein paar GIFs vorschlagen, welche du dann in den Chat senden kannst.

Wenn Freunde dir GIFs senden, kannst du diese in der Cloud speichern. Tippe einfach auf das GIF und dann auf "Speichern". Nun erscheint es unter GIF im Sticker-Panel.

Kanäle sind klasse, um Nachrichten an unbegrenzt viele Leute zu senden. Z.B. wichtige Infos oder einfach nur lustige Sachen. Im Gegensatz zu einer Gruppe können Mitglieder nicht sehen, wer den Kanal abonniert hat. Schreiberlaubnis haben nur Kanalersteller und die Administratoren des Kanals. So bleibt alles schön übersichtlich.

Kanäle können unbegrenzt viele Mitglieder haben, sie haben eine dauerhafte Internetadresse und man kann sie wunschweise auch in der Telegram-Suche erscheinen lassen. Ein Beispiel: Unser deutschsprachiger Kanal, welcher ausführlich die App-Änderungen erklärt https://t.me/TelegramDE

Wir haben keinen eigenen Bot Store, die Bot Plattform ist für alle zugänglich und jeder Entwickler kann eigene erstellen. Hier sind ein paar Beispiele - aber beachte bitte, dass alle genannten Bots von ganz normalen Nutzern erstellt wurden und nicht vom Telegram-Team.

@TriviaBot - teste dein Allgemeinwissen oder trete gegen deine Freunde an, indem du den Bot zu einer Gruppe hinzufügst.
@gamebot - Spiele Mini-Spiele alleine oder versuche die Rekorde deiner Freunde zu schlagen.
@AlertBot – stelle eine Zeit ein und der Bot wird dir eine Erinnerung schicken.

Inline-Bots sind noch einfacher zu handhaben. Es reicht, den @Bot-Benutzernamen in das Chatfenster einzutippen, gefolgt von ein paar Stichworten, und schon zeigt dir der Bot ein passendes Ergebnis an. Probier es doch mal mit den folgenden Bots: @gif, @vid, @pic, @pic, @wiki, @imdb oder auch @bold.

Sei allgemein immer vorsichtig, wenn du Bots findest, die dir kostenfreie Kryptowährungungen oder Wallet-Dienste anbieten wollen. Diese sind nicht offiziell und stehen mit Telegram in keinerlei Verbindung.

Wenn dir jemand extrem hohe Renditen für Anlagen anbietet, ist es fast immer zu gut, um wahr zu sein. Am Besten um solche Sachen einen großen Bogen machen, so bist du auf der sicheren Seite.

{VALUE}
Die Spiele-Plattform von Telegram erlaubt es Botentwicklern eigene in-Chat Spiele zu erstellen. Leider kann das Telegram Team einzelne Spiele nicht steuern, daher kann es durchaus möglich sein, daß man bei dem einen oder anderen Spiel tricksen kann. Um das zu verhindern, müssten wir nicht nur die Spielergebnisse synchronisieren sondern jede einzelne Aktion des Spielers und das wäre für Entwickler keine leichte Aufgabe.

Tricksen (cheating) ist ein Problem vieler Spiele, auch Spiele die in den jeweiligen App Stores direkt eingestellt werden. In jedem Fall wäre es die Aufgabe der Spieleentwickler, "Cheater" zu erwischen. Mit der Zeit werden mehr und mehr Spiele von Drittentwicklern erstellt, wir hoffen, daß du dann Spiele finden wirst, die genauso funktionieren wie du es dir vorstellst.

Bei Telegram brauchst du die Medien aus deinem lebenslangen Chatverlauf nicht auf deinem Gerät zu speichern. Wenn du Daten von deinem lokalen Speicher löschst, werden sie erneut heruntergeladen, sobald du auf sie zugreifst. Das bedeutet, dass du nichts verlierst und Telegram immer nur minimalen Speicherplatz auf deinem Gerät einnimmt.

Geh einfach in die Telegram Einstellungen → Daten und Speicher → Speichernutzung. Dort kannst du festlegen, welche unbenutzen Daten vom Gerät gelöscht werden sollen.

Es ist möglich temporäre Daten aus individuellen Kanälen und öffentlichen Gruppen zu leeren: In der Chatliste den Chat gedrückt halten, rechts oben auf die drei Punkte und dann ""Aus dem Cache entfernen".

Du kannst deine SD-Karte als Speicheroption für Telegram-Daten auswählen: Einstellungen → Daten und Speicher → Speicherpfad.

Wenn du nach einer Möglichkeit suchst, Speicher freizugeben, kannst du stattdessen temporäre Dateien aus dem sogenannten "Cache" deines Geräts entfernen. Es lädt sich dann erneut aus der Cloud herunter, wenn du wieder im Chat darauf zugreifen möchtest - so verlieren du nichts und die App nimmt immer nur ganz wenig Platz ein.

So leerst du den Cache: Einstellungen von Telegram > Daten und Speicher > Speicherverwaltung. Dort kannst du manuell den "Cache" leeren oder auch einstellen, dass die App das Ganze regelmässig automatisch im Hintergrund macht.

IFTTT ist ein kostenloser Drittanbieter, der es Nutzern erlaubt, verschiedene Anwendungen zu verknüpfen. Du könntest z.B. dein E-Mail-Postfach mit Telegram verknüpfen und wirst so zeitnah über neue eingehende Emails informiert. Ebenfalls wäre es möglich - sofern die entsprechende Hardware von IFTTT unterstützt wird - deine Kaffeemaschine per Telegram zu steuern oder sogar deinen Fernseher ein- und auszuschalten. Mehr als 300 verschiedene Dienste unterstützt IFTTT bereits und Telegram ist nun auch dabei.

Um zu beginnen, schreibe einfach den @IFTTT Bot an und befolge die englischsprachige Anweisungen. Kurzform: Du musst ein Konto bei IFTTT erstellen, dann deine Wunschdienste mit Telegram verknüpfen (z.B. dein Gmail E-Mail Postfach, Spotify oder auch Twitter). Ein paar Beispiele haben wir unter https://ifttt.com/telegram erstellt. Beachte bitte auch unseren Kanal https://telegram.me/TelegramDE, dort werden wir regelmässig interessante Verknüpfungen vorstellen.

{VALUE}
Geheime Chats:

- setzen auf Ende-zu-Ende-Verschlüsselung
- haben einen optionalen Selbstzerstörungstimer für alle Nachrichtenarten (Textnachrichten, Videos, Bilder, etc.)
- keine Cloud-Synchronisation
- senden eine Screenshot-Benachrichtigung
- werden bei Abmeldung unbrauchbar
- Erlauben keine Weiterleitung von Nachrichten
- verhindern eine Datensicherung
- nur auf einem Endgerät nutzbar
- sind ideal als temporärer Chat

Zusammengefasst sind Geheime Chats also super praktisch für zwischendurch; für dauerhafte Chats sind die Cloud-Chats besser geeignet. Alle Chats bei Telegram sind natürlich immer verschlüsselt. Mehr Infos zu geheimen Chats findest du hier: https://telegram.org/faq/de#geheime-chats

Cloud-Chats (alle Chats außer den Geheimen Chats):

- ideal für dauerhafte Chats
- liegen verschlüsselt in der Telegram Cloud
- sind auf beliebig vielen Geräten nutzbar
- bleiben bei Neuinstallation erhalten
- Inhalte können weitergeleitet werden

Zusammenfassend sind die Cloud-Chats also sehr sicher und verschlüsselt in der Telegram-Cloud immer für dich verfügbar.

{VALUE}
Telegram Cloud Chats (auch Gruppenchats) werden verschlüsselt in der Cloud von Telegram gespeichert. Dadurch kannst du diese Art von Chats vom jedem Gerät aus fortführen, auch im Falle einer Neuinstallation von Telegram. Wenn du etwas bei dir im Chat löschst, ist es aber auch in der Cloud für immer weg.

Geheime Chats setzen auf Ende-zu-Ende-Verschlüsselung und können nur vom Start- und Zielgerät entschlüsselt werden. Nachteil: Man kann auf Geheime Chats nicht von anderen Geräten aus zugreifen und im Falle einer Neuinstallation von Telegram, oder wenn man sich abmeldet, wären deine Geheimen Chats für immer weg.

Geheime Chats verfügen über einen optionalen Timer (zwischen 1 Sekunde bis zu 1 Woche) für alle Arten von Nachrichten.

{KEYS}
1devicede

{VALUE}
Während du auf deine Cloud Chats jederzeit von jedem deiner Geräte zugreifen kannst, sind Geheime Chats nicht Teil der Telegram Cloud und somit auf ein Gerät beschränkt. Aus diesem Grund kannst du dir sicher sein, dass sie sicher in deinem Telefonspeicher liegen, sofern du auf dein Handy achtest und es immer bei dir trägst. Geheime Chats benutzen Ende-zu-Ende-Verschlüsselung, sie können also nicht genauso komfortabel und einfach synchronisiert werden wie die Cloud Chats. Eventuell unterstützen wir Geheime Chats auf mehreren Geräten in der Zukunft.

In der Zwischenzeit könntest du die Cloud Chats benutzen. Diese erlauben die Synchronisierung von Chats auf all deinen Geräten. Beachte bitte, dass Cloud Chats ebenfalls verschlüsselt sind und durch die einmalig verteilte Telegram Infrastruktur abgesichert sind.

{QUESTION}
(DE) Why are there no Secret Chats on desktop apps?
{KEYS}

secretchatsdesktopde
{VALUE}
Geheime Chats benötigen dauerhaften Speicher auf dem Gerät, etwas was weder Telegram Desktop noch Telegram Web derzeit bieten. Eventuell fügen wir diese Funktion der Zukunft hinzu. Im Moment lädt Telegram Desktop (und Telegram Web) deine Chats bei jedem Aufruf und verwirft sie, sobald du die App beendest. Für Geheime Chats bedeutet das: Bei jedem Herunterfahren deines PCs würden die Geheimen Chats entfernt werden.

Geheime Chats sind außerdem gerätespezifisch und verschwinden bei einer Abmeldung. Berücksichtigt man das, so ist es einfacher, wenn du diese Art von Chats nur auf dem Gerät benutzt, welches du ständig bei dir trägst. Sofern du dir Gedanken um deine Sicherheit der Cloud Chats in der Desktopversion machen solltest: Alle Chats sind bei Telegram immer verschlüsselt und durch die einmalig verteilte Telegram Infrastruktur zusätzlich noch abgesichert.

{VALUE}
Alle Telegram Daten sind verschlüsselt und können nicht von deinem Internetzugangsbetreiber, Netzwerkadministrator oder zufälligen Hackern entschlüsselt werden. Daten aus Cloud Chats werden in mehreren Rechenzentren rund um den Globus gespeichert, die von verschiedenen juristischen Personen verteilt auf mehrere Gerichtsbarkeiten gesteuert werden. Die entsprechenden Schlüssel werden zerlegt sowie niemals an der selben Stelle wie die Daten gespeichert, die sie schützen sollen. Aus diesem Grund sind mehrere Gerichtsbeschlüsse aus verschiedenen Ländern erforderlich, um uns zur Herausgabe von Daten zu zwingen. Mehr dazu unter: https://telegram.org/faq/de#f-reagiert-ihr-auf-datenanfragen

Geheime Chats sind für alle Nutzer gedacht, die einfach noch mehr wollen. Sie benutzen Ende-zu-Ende-Verschlüsselung, es gibt also keine Möglichkeit Daten - ohne Zugriff auf dein Gerät - zu entschlüsseln. Zudem brauchst du Telegram gar nicht bei dieser Art von Chats vertrauen — die Geheimhaltung ist clientseitig garantiert und jeder kann den Quelltext der Telegram Apps prüfen.

Wenn du allgemein um deine Sicherheit besorgt bist, könntest du einige wichtige Vorkehrungen treffen: Du könntest die zweistufige Bestätigung in den Telegram Einstellungen aktivieren und vielleicht sogar den Pincodeschutz mit einem sicheren Passwort, um die App zu schützen. Beide Einstellungen findest du im Bereich "Privatsphäre und Sicherheit". Bitte frag mich, wenn etwas unklar ist.

Es öffnet sich direkt ein Chat mit dir auf Telegram - ideal, um ihn mit Freunden zu teilen oder auf deiner Internetseite oder in sozialen Netzwerken.

{VALUE}
Du kannst andere Telegram Nutzer anhand ihrer öffentlichen Benutzernamen suchen, wenn sie einen erstellt haben. Du musst auf jeden Fall mindestens 5 Zeichen eingeben. Mehr über Benutzernamen findest du hier: https://telegram.org/faq/de#benutzernamen

Android, Android X: Tippe auf die Lupe oben rechts in der Chatliste und schreibe etwas in das Suchfeld.

iOS: In der Chatliste bis ganz nach oben scrollen und in die Zeile mit der Lupe tippen.

WP: In der Kontaktübersicht auf die Lupe tippen und dann in die Eingabezeile schreiben.

Benutzernamen werden nach dem "Wer zuerst kommt"-Prinzip vergeben.

Wir verstehen sehr gut, dass Benutzernamen Teil der Online-Identität für einige geworden sind. Wenn dein gewünschter Benutzername bereits belegt ist, helfen wir dir gerne, deinen Namen zu erhalten. Voraussetzung dafür ist aber, dass man den gleichen Benutzernamen bei mindestens zwei der folgenden Dienste besitzt: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram.

Wenn das bei dir der Fall ist, kontaktiere bitte @username_bot und folge den Bot-Anweisungen.

{QUESTION}
(DE) How do I verify my account?
{KEYS}
verifyude
verifyuserde
{VALUE}
Tut mir leid. Telegram verifiziert aktuell keine Benutzerkonten. Die Verifikation gibt es nur für große und aktive offizielle Kanäle, öffentliche Gruppen und Bots.
https://telegram.org/verify

Beachte bitte, dass eine Verifikation dir keine wirklichen Vorteile bringt. Es ist einfach nur ein kleines Symbol, was anzeigt, dass dein Konto ein offizielles Konto ist. Das gleiche Resultat bekommst du ebenfalls durch eine reine Bewerbung deines Benutzernamens, z.B. auf deiner Internetseite.

{QUESTION}
(DE) How do I verify my channel? (bot, public group)
{KEYS}

Das Telegram-Team überprüft in der Regel aktive offizielle Kanäle, Bots oder öffentliche Gruppen, die Konten bei mindestens zwei dieser Dienste verifiziert haben:
1. TikTok
2. Instagram
3. Facebook
4. YouTube
5. Twitter
6. VK
7. Snapchat

Wenn das der Fall ist, füge bitte einen Link zu deinem Kanal bei Telegram in den Profilen der genanten Dienste hinzu - damit Telegram sehen kann, dass diese tatsächlich dir gehören. Sobald das erledigt ist, melde dich bei Telegrams @VerifyBot, der dir die weiteren Schritte erklärt. Unter https://telegram.org/verify findest du mehr Informationen.

Um einen Pincode zu erstellen: Telegram Einstellungen → Privatsphäre und Sicherheit → Pincode-Sperre.

Sobald du einen Pincode einstellst, siehst du ein kleines Schloss über deiner Chatliste. Tippe darauf, um die App zu sperren. Wenn du das nächste Mal Telegram öffnen willst, musst du den Code eintippen.

Wurde die App gesperrt, erscheinen auch nicht mehr Textauszüge und Namen in den Benachrichtigungen. Du kannst auch die Auto-Sperre in den Pincode-Einstellungen aktivieren, wenn du die App nicht manuell sperren möchtest.

Derzeit ist die kürzeste Zeitspanne 1 Minute, was für die meisten ausreicht. So sperrt sich die App ziemlich schnell, aber du musst nicht jedes Mal den Pincode eintippen, wenn du eine neue Nachricht bekommst und dein Handy nur gerade wieder eingesteckt hast.

Eventuell werden wir noch weitere Einstellungen in der Zukunft hinzufügen.

{QUESTION}
(DE) How do I unlock my app with touch ID?

Die Telefonnummer ist derzeit die einzige Möglichkeit für uns, einen Telegram-Nutzer zu identifizieren.

Da wir keine anderen Daten von dir haben, bedeutet das: Wer die Nummer hat, dem gehört das Konto. Das bedeutet auch, dass du keine Daten löschen kannst, solange du nicht von mindestens einem Gerät Zugriff auf das zu löschende Telegram Konto hast.

Mehr darüber in unseren FAQs:

Bitte beachte, dass dein Telegram Konto automatisch nach 6 Monaten gelöscht wird, wenn du Telegram in dieser Zeit nicht genutzt hast und sofern du nichts anderes eingestellt hast. Diesen Zeitraum kannst du in den Einstellungen > Privatsphäre und Sicherheit anpassen (zwischen 1 Monat bis zu 1 Jahr).

Du kannst dein altes Telegram-Konto und damit alle Kontakte, Cloud Chats, Gruppen und deine Blockierungsliste auf eine neue Nummer übertragen.

Und so gehts: Telegram-Einstellungen > auf Telefonnummer tippen > Nummer ändern > neue Nummer eintippen. Wenn nötig, den neuen Code, den du per SMS auf die neue Nummer bekommst, eingeben - Fertig!

Damit das funktioniert, stelle bitte sicher, dass kein Telegram-Konto mit der neuen Nummer verbunden ist. Wenn doch, lösche bitte das neue Konto, bevor du mit der Übertragung startest.

Wenn du deine alte Telefonnummer nicht mehr nutzt, gibt der Netzbetreiber die an einen neuen Kunden weiter. Deswegen ist es wichtig, dass du deine Telegram Nummer aktuell hältst, da bei uns der Besitzer der Nummer auch der Besitzer des Telegram-Kontos ist.

Um deine Nummer zu ändern, gehe auf Einstellungen, tippe auf deine Telefonnummer, und dann auf Nummer ändern.

Bitte beachte, dass alle deine Kontakte deine neue Nummer ihrem Telefonbuch hinzugefügt bekommen, sofern sie deine alte Nummer gespeichert hatten und du sie nicht blockiert hattest.

Wenn du deine aktuelle Nummer bei Telegram ändern willst, musst du sicher stellen, dass mit der neuen Telefonnummer noch kein Telegramkonto existiert. Wenn doch, musst du es vor dem Transfer löschen.

Das Konto wird unwiederbringlich gelöscht - also stelle sicher, dass du von dem Konto nichts mehr benötigst.

Wenn du fortfahren möchtest, findest du unten die einfachsten Schritte, um diesen Prozess durchzuführen.

1. Verwende ein mobiles Gerät, um dich mit dem Konto anzumelden, das derzeit mit deiner neuen Nummer verbunden ist. Mit den Telegram-Apps kannst du bei mehreren Konten gleichzeitig angemeldet bleiben:
Android: Wische in der Chatliste nach rechts, um das Menü zu öffnen → Pfeil nach unten → Konto hinzufügen.
iOS: Gehe zu Telegram Einstellungen → Bearbeiten → Konto hinzufügen.
Schalte dort "Kontakte synchronisieren" aus, gib deine neue Telefonnummer ein und melde dich mit dem Code ein, den du per SMS an die Nummer erhältst.

2. https://telegram.org/deactivate - kopiere diesen Link, öffne ihn in deinem Browser und gib dort deine neue Telefonnummer im internationalen Format ein. 

3. Du erhältst nun ein Passwort über Telegram (behalte die App im Auge, in der du dich in Schritt 1 angemeldet hast). Gib das Passwort ein und lösche das Konto.

4. Öffne nun dein Hauptkonto und gehe zu Telegram Einstellungen → Telefonnummer → Nummer ändern → gib deine neue Nummer ein. Falls nötig, gib den Code ein, den du per SMS an die neue Nummer erhältst.

Fertig!

Zuallererst: Das tut uns echt leid. Leider ist die Telefonnummer derzeit die einzige Möglichkeit für uns, einen Telegram-Nutzer zu identifizieren. Deswegen bitte so schnell wie möglich:

1. Zuallererst musst du deinem Mobilfunkbetreiber Bescheid geben, so dass dieser die alte SIM sperren und dir eine neue SIM mit deiner alten Nummer erstellen kann.
2. Falls du auf einem anderen Gerät mit deinem Telegram Konto angemeldet bist, gehe in Einstellungen > Privatsphäre und Sicherheit > Aktive Sitzungen (oder Einstellungen > Geräte bei den mobilen Apps) > Alle anderen Geräte abmelden. Das wird alle anderen Sitzungen abmelden. Wenn deine alte SIM zu diesem Zeitpunkt schon gesperrt ist, kann niemand mehr auf deine Daten zugreifen. Du kannst deine normale Nutzung von Telegram wieder aufnehmen.
3. Wenn du mit keinem anderen Gerät bei Telegram angemeldet bist, musst du warten, bis du deine neue SIM mit der alten Nummer bekommst. Dann einfach bei Telegram anmelden, in die Einstellungen wechseln und "Alle anderen Sitzungen beenden". Sobald du die neue SIM hast, kannst du deine normale Nutzung von Telegram wieder aufnehmen.

Bitte beachte, dass dein Telegram Konto automatisch nach 6 Monaten gelöscht wird, wenn du Telegram in dieser Zeit nicht genutzt hast und sofern du nichts anderes eingestellt hast. Diesen Zeitraum kannst du in den Einstellungen > Privatsphäre und Sicherheit anpassen (zwischen 1 Monat bis zu 1 Jahr).

{QUESTION}

{KEYS}

Das Abmelden bei Telegram ist in der Regel unnötig, weil du ja auf so vielen Geräten gleichzeitig Telegram geöffnet haben kannst, wie du willst. Zudem schicken wir deinen neuen Code auf ein anderes Telegram Gerät von dir (wenn du es aktiv nutzt), sobald du dich wieder anmelden willst. Das spart dir Zeit.

Android, Android X: Chatliste nach rechts wischen → Einstellungen → "..." rechts oben → Abmelden.

iOS, macOS: Einstellungen > Bearbeiten > und ganz unten 'Abmelden'.

WP: Auf "…" in der Chatliste tippen > Einstellungen > bis ganz nach unten scrollen > "Abmelden".

Wenn du dich abmeldest, verlierst du alle deine Geheimen Chats.

Mit Telegram Passport kannst du dich ganz einfach bei Webseiten und Diensten anmelden, die eine Identitätsprüfung erfordern. Du kannst deine Dokumente hochladen und diese mit Diensten teilen, die eine "echte" Identifizierung benötigen (ICOs, etc.).

Diese Daten werden in der Telegram Cloud mit Ende-zu-Ende-Verschlüsselung geschützt. Niemand, einschließlich Telegram, kann ohne deine Erlaubnis darauf zugreifen.

Sobald du diese Autorisierungsmethode auf einer unterstützten Webseite verwendet hast, kannst du deine Daten unter Einstellungen > Privatsphäre und Sicherheit > Telegram Passport (bei iOS: Einstellungen > Telegram Passport) einsehen. Beachte bitte, dass das Menü wirklich erst erscheint, sobald du Daten hochgeladen hast.

Ich fürchte, du kannst keine SMS-Codes verwenden, um dich in den Telegram-Apps für Desktop und Web anzumelden, also musst du dich zuerst bei Telegram auf dem Handy anmelden. Wenn du kein Smartphone hast, können wir dir folgenden Alternativen empfehlen:

1. Bitte einen Freund oder ein Familienmitglied, dir das Telefon zu leihen. Melde dich dort bei Telegram an und erhalte dann einen Anmeldecode für dein Desktop-Gerät.
Hinweis: Schalte "Kontakte synchronisieren" aus, wenn du dich bei Telegram auf dem Telefon einer anderen Person anmeldest, damit die App deine Kontakte nicht mit deren Telefonbuch synchronisiert.

2. Benutze einen Emulator, um Android auf deinem PC auszuführen und installiere Telegram für Android. Es gibt im Internet verschiedene. Du könntest nach "android emulators" in Suchmaschinen suchen.

Es tut mir leid, das zu hören. Videoanrufe befinden sich noch in der Entwicklung und werden in zukünftigen Versionen verbessert werden.

Kannst du bitte helfen, dieses Problem zu untersuchen? Hier sind ein paar wichtige Fragen:

1. Beschreibe genau, was passiert. (z.B. Du hast deine eigene Stimme gehört, das Video war verzerrt, usw.)
2. Welche Plattform (iOS, Android, etc.) und welche Telegram Version benutzt dein Chatpartner?
3. Kannst du uns bitte das technische Protokoll des Anrufs senden, wo du Probleme hattest?  

Suche dazu nach dem Anruf in deinem Chat, dann:
Android: Tippe neben der Videoanruf-Nachricht > Anruf bewerten > Bewerte den Anruf mit einem Stern und wähle "Technische Infos mitsenden" und tipp dann auf Senden. Das wird die Datei an einen neuen Chat 'VOIP Support' senden. Wenn du es von dort aus zu uns hier im Support weiterleiten könntest, wäre das eine große Hilfe.
iOS: Halte die Videoanruf-Nachricht gedrückt > Statistiken teilen > wähle diesen Chat hier aus.
Desktop: Öffne den Ordner der App > DebugLogs Unterordner > Sende uns die Datei "last_call_log.txt".
macOS: Rechtsklick auf die Videoanruf-Nachricht > Anrufprotokolle teilen > dann diesen Chat hier mit uns aus auswählen.

Wenn möglich, bitte deinen Gesprächspartner, dir seine/ihre Protokoll-Datei für den Anruf zu schicken. Diese mir dann hier im Chat weiterleiten. Wenn etwas unklar ist oder du auf Probleme stößt, lass es mich bitte wissen - ich helfe dir gerne weiter!

- Besonders ältere Android-Endgeräte verfügen leider nur über sehr wenig Arbeitsspeicher. Der zuständige Benachrichtigungsdienst verbraucht teilweise etwas mehr Speicher und so könnte Android den Dienst einfach aufgrund von Speichermangel selbstständig beenden. Da hilft leider nur noch ein regelmäßiger Neustart des Endgerätes (Tablet, Smartphone…), damit wieder Speicher freigegeben wird.

Prüfe als erstes in den Telefoneinstellungen, ob Telegram die Berechtigung hat, deine Kontakte zu lesen. Wenn du einige deiner Kontakte in den Telegram Kontakten sehen kannst, bedeutet es, dass die App bereits Zugriff hat und du kannst mit dem nächsten Schritt fortfahren.

Dann probiere bitte diesen Trick: 
1. Gehe ich die Telegram Einstellungen bis zum Ende, wo die Versionsnummer zu sehen ist.
2. Tippe und halte "Telegram für Android" gedrückt.
3. Tippe und halte Telegram erneut gedrückt und es erscheint ein Menü.
4. Tippe auf "Kontakt neu laden".

Wenn du diesen Fehler in einem Geheimen Chat angezeigt bekommst, liegt es daran, dass deine Androidversion Screenshots verhindert. Geheime Chats sind für alle, die die höchste Stufe der Geheimhaltung wünschen. Aus diesem Grund kannst du auch keine Nachrichten aus Geheimen Chats weiterleiten.

(DE) The badge counter is showing unread messages, but I don't have any (Samsung)
{KEYS}
samsungde

{VALUE}
Leider gibt es bei Samsunggeräten einen Fehler, der nur von Samsung behoben werden kann und nicht von unserer Seite. Bis Samsung es behebt, kannst du folgendes probieren: Wechsel in die Handyeinstellungen > Einstellungen > Anwendungsmanager > "Alle" Tab > suche nach 'BadgeProvider' > Daten Löschen > Gerät neustarten. Das ist übrigens "nur" ein kosmetisches Problem. Samsung merkt sich den alten Zählerstand und überschreibt ihn nicht mit dem aktuellsten. Bedeutet also nicht, dass du zwingend 2 ungelesene Nachrichten hast.

Es sieht aus, als ob dein Konto durch die Telegram Antispam-Systeme eingeschränkt wurde. Um zu erfahren, warum das passiert sein könnte oder auch um einfach falsche Einschränkungen zu melden, wende dich bitte an @SpamBot.

Wir sind hier im Chat nur ehrenamtliche Helfer, keine Mitarbeiter von Telegram. Wir können daher leider nicht helfen, Kontoeinschränkungen zu beseitigen.

(DE) How can I stop Telegram from using so much battery? (Android)
{KEYS}
drainde
batteryde

{VALUE}
Da es viele Gründe haben kann, warum das bei dir so ist, schon mal Entschuldigung für den sehr langen Text, der gleich kommt:

Bitte überprüfe folgende Punkte:

- Falls du einen Batterieoptimierer/Taskmanager/Taskkiller oder so etwas in der Art installiert hast: Bitte setze Telegram auf die Liste der erlaubten Apps. Wenn sich Telegram nicht in der Ignorierliste befindet, wird Telegram beendet. Telegram startet dann automatisch neu, wird wieder beendet und das Resultat ist extremer Akkuverbrauch.

- Telegram benutzt Google Cloud Notifications (GCM), um die App aufzuwecken und um dich über neue Nachrichten zu informieren. Bitte stelle sicher, dass die Google Play Dienste bei dir auf dem Handy installiert sind (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.gms).

Da GCM nicht sonderlich zuverlässig ist, haben wir einen eigenen Mitteilungsdienst eingebaut, um dich über neue Nachrichten zu informieren. Diesen findest du in den Telegram Einstellungen > Mitteilungen und Töne > "Keep-Alive-Dienst" und "Hintergrundverbindung".

Beide Einstellungen könnten deine Batterielaufzeit beeinflussen. Wenn du beide deaktivierst und nur Google Cloud Benachrichtigungen nutzt, könnte dies zu unzuverlässigen Benachrichtigungen führen.

(DE) I’ve heard Telegram was cracked by the FSB, is it true?
{KEYS}

{VALUE}
Diese Gerüchte stammen aus einem "Bericht", der wahrscheinlich gar nicht echt ist, siehe dazu https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/jan/10/buzzfeed-publishes-donald-trump-russia-documents-ethics-questions.

Sofern es kein Gerücht ist, handelt es sich wahrscheinlich um das Abfangen von SMS bei zwei russischen Oppositionellen (siehe http://fortune.com/2016/05/06/telegram-activists-hack/), diese hat nicht die zweistufige Bestätigung aktiviert. Lass es mich wissen, wenn du mehr über die zweistufige Bestätigung wissen möchtest. 

Bzgl. des Artikels: Journalisten vom Guardian, der Financial Times und andere renomierte Zeitungen hatten es seit Juni 2016 und keiner ist bis heute in der Lage eine einzige Aussage davon zu bestätigen.

{KEYS}

Laut Wikileaks soll das CIA Möglichkeiten haben, Smartphones zu hacken, um *vor der Verschlüsselung* den Nachrichtenverkehr zu sammeln. Dies ist kein App-Problem, sondern eines des Betriebssystems bzw. Gerätes. Aus diesem Grund ist die Benennung einer bestimmten App in diesem Zusammenhang irreführend.

Die guten Nachrichten sind, dass derzeit "Year Zero" wahrscheinlich für die Mehrheit der Telegram-Nutzer irrelevant ist. Ausführliche Infos und Tipps, was man selbst unternehmen kann, gibt es im folgenden englischsprachigen Beitrag:

Das ist ein Versuch, viele Klicks mit einem irreführendem Titel zu bekommen. Nichts wurde geknackt - der Autor des Artikels möchte nur sein Produkt bewerben. Kein Verschlüsselungsprofi würde diese Argumentation ernst nehmen (siehe zum Beispiel die Kommentare auf Hacker News - leider nur auf Englisch verfügbar: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9095059).

Der Artikel sagt so etwas wie: "Wenn ich deinen Wohnungschlüssel hätte, könnte ich die Tür zu deiner Wohnung öffnen" aus.

Solange du also niemandem deine Schlüssel gibst, brauchst du dir keine Sorgen zu machen. Um dein Gerät vor Schaden zu bewahren, mach bitte einen Bogen um verdächtige Links, halte dein System auf dem neuesten Stand — und roote dein Handy nicht.

Und schenke niemals Leuten vertrauen, die versuchen durch Panikmache ihr Produkt zu verkaufen.
