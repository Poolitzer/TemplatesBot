I developed this bot while I was part of the TSF to manage and auto-update templates for answering user questions.

I release this code as is, it will be of no operational value since it relies on TSF intern updates, and I have written it years ago, so the quality will be bad. It works however. Maybe some code parts are of interested to you.

The folder templates is supposed to be served on a webserver, on the domain provided in templates.py. Everything else should work on your end.

This bot is written with python 3.7 and python-telegram-bot V12.0.0b1. Higher python and ptb versions could work.
